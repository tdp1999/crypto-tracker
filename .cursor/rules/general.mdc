- Use guard clauses instead of nested conditionals.
- Use descriptive variable names like isUserLoggedIn, userPermissions, and fetchData() to communicate intent clearly.
- Replace hard-coded values with named constants.
- Don't over-comment the codeâ€”only add comments if the code is complex, has non-obvious side effects, or is long.
- Don't suggest whitespace changes.
- Don't use barrel files.
- Always use pnpm in this project.
