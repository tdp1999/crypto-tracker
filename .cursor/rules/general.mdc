- Use guard clauses to simplify control flow and avoid deep nesting.
- Name variables and functions clearly and descriptively (e.g., isUserLoggedIn, userPermissions, fetchData).
    - Keep names concise—ideally fewer than 5 words.
- Define named constants instead of using hard-coded values, to make code easier to read and maintain.
- Add comments when they enhance clarity, such as when:
    - The logic is complex
    - There are non-obvious behaviors
    - A section of code is unusually long
- Maintain current formatting and whitespace—assume code is properly formatted unless stated otherwise.
- Import dependencies directly from their source paths, rather than using barrel files (index.ts).
- Use pnpm as the package manager for this project.
- Add the comment // FLAG: PENDING VERIFICATION to every file you create, even if not explicitly requested. I will manually review and remove this flag later.
